# This is a readme file

Here i'm going to describe what is going on in my project

And now we are going to try and get this onto my github account

# All git commands are run in the terminal not the console
# first before we could commit (dropdown G+ sideways from above), we had to enter who we are i.e. username and gmail on github which is the code below, that I had to run line by line separately on the Terminal

git config --global user.email "ruchirajha@gmail.com"
git config --global user.name "ruchirajha"

# Edit
label the file README.md because github recognizes it
** THIS IS IN BOLD**
